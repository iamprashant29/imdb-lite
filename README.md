# IMDB Lite

This project was generated using Angular CLI version 20.3.15.

**IMDB Lite** is a web application that provides overview of the top cinemas around the world. Users can view the details of top Global Movies, TV Shows and movies from world's biggest movie industry in the world - **Bolllywood** . User can also search the database with the help of search funtionality. The app offers a clean, user-friendly interface and is built using modern web technologies, making it a great tool for exploring movies data in a user-friendly way.

The application is built using Angular v20, Typescript and RxJS, and leverages some of the performance optimization techniques like lazy loading of the singleton components.

Used CSS flexbox to provide the responsive layout and BEM methodology to organize CSS classes.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
